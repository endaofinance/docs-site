# Introduction

## What is EnDAO?

EnDAO is a decentralized finance protocol designed to fund projects or people while minimizing the risk for funders. This is done through the "DeFi" ecosystem and is modeled after traditional finance endowments.

Funders invest capital into vault contracts. The capital is then invested in the DeFi ecosystem to generate income. The project requesting the funding receives its funding through the income generated.

## Why EnDAO?

Funding takes many forms. For example, something can be funded using debt, equity (stock purchases), pre-sales, grants, or donations.

The drawback to all of these funding options is that they carry risk. Risk that the fundee will steal the funds, risk that the funded project will never be completed, etc. There are plenty of risks when it comes to providing capital to a project. As a result, capital works to minimize risks, which increases the friction for fundraising projects.

This friction is the problem that EnDAO hopes to minimize.

We are working on a funding protocol that uses primitives in the DeFi ecosystem to provide the capital that people, or projects need to build something amazing.

The system is trustless and lower risk in that the fundee never takes custody of the capital. Instead, the capital is used to generate income and the yield along with a draw is what is used to fund the project. The result is an instant endowment that can be spun up to fund a given project while minimizing the capital at risk of the funder.
