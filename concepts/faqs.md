# FAQs

## Is EnDAO only for non profits?

No, the EnDAO protocol can be used to fund anything. Non profits are just one of the many use cases.

## What tokens can be deposited?

Currently assets deposited into the Endaoment contracts must be liquidity pool tokens. In the future we will support single token deposits.

## Does the beneficiary have access to the assets I deposit?

No. This is one of the reasons that this use case works perfectly on the blockchain.&#x20;

Assets are deposited into a smart contract and the depositor always has the ability to withdraw the assets at any time. At no point does the beneficiary or the DAO have direct control over the funds.

## How do Endaoments generate income?

Income in the DeFi ecosystem can be generated various ways. The two main methods that EnDAO focuses on are:

1. Proof Of Stake: Using this Blockchain users can stake tokens and help generate blocks. During this block generation users who have staked tokens receive new tokens as a reward. This reward is effectively income generated from the staked assets. You can read more about Proof of Stake here: [https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/12/31/pos\_faq.html](https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/12/31/pos\_faq.html)
2. &#x20;Yield Farming: There are a few protocols in DeFi that generate yield through things like lending or being liquidity pools. [Compound](https://compound.finance) for example is a peer to peer lending protocol where users can lend crypto to other users. The lenders receive income in the form of interest payments.

Using the above methods, [Endaoments](endaoments.md) are able to generate the income they require to help fund projects.

## Is EnDAO a blockchain?

EnDAO is an application built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. We have plans to extend to Ethereum Layer 2 protocols.
