# FAQs

## Is EnDAO only for non profits?

No, the EnDAO protocol can be used to fund anything. Non profits are just one of the many use cases.

## What tokens can be deposited?

Currently assets deposited into the Endaoment contracts must be liquidity pool tokens. In the future we will support single token deposits.

## Does the beneficiary have access to the assets I deposit?

No. This is one of the reasons that this use case works perfectly on the blockchain.&#x20;

Assets are deposited into a smart contract and the depositor always has the ability to withdraw the assets at any time. At no point does the beneficiary or the DAO have direct control over the funds.



## Is EnDAO a blockchain?

EnDAO is an application built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. We have plans to extend to Ethereum Layer 2 protocols.
