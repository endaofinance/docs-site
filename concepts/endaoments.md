# Endaoments

Letâ€™s say you are an open source developer who needs to fund a project with $150k for a year. To do this you would need to generate $12.5k a month in cash for a year. To generate this $12.5k you could buy an apartment complex to rent or any other asset that cash flows $12.5k per month. That $12.5k then can be used to fund the $150k project.

This is a pretty basic example that is broadly used every day by trust funds, pensions, endowments, etc. Historically, the ability to fund things this way was constrained by access to the capital since not everyone has access to $3M to buy an apartment complex.

Endao extends on this idea by using the blockchain to allow communities to pool the capital required into Endaoments. Assets that fund these endaoments are deployed into the decentralized finance/staking ecosystem to generate cashflow that can be used to fund projects.

Endao expresses this relationship between the funder the the beneficiary in a smart contract called an Endaoment. When a funder deposits assets into an Endaoment the contract manages the funds and generates an income that the beneficiary can use to fund their work or project.
