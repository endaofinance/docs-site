# Software as a service providers

The Software As A Service (SaaS) model lends itself uniquely to this type of a funding arrangement due to SaaS monthly / annual cost structures.&#x20;

Rather then asking for direct payment in exchange for access to their software, SaaS creators can ask that users fund an Endaoment for a certain amount. Membership of the Endaoment can be verified by the software creator on the blockchain and give access to the user based on the contribution level.
